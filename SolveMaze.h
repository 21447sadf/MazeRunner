#pragma once

// Here you can include any necessary headers specific to solving the maze.
// For instance, if you return a path or a maze data structure, you might need <vector> or other standard libraries.

#include <vector>

// Function declaration for solveMaze
// This is a simple version that takes no arguments and returns void.
// You might want to expand this based on your exact needs (e.g., passing the maze as an argument, returning the path, etc.)
void findSolution();

// Optionally, if the solveMaze function takes in a maze and returns a path or some result, you can modify its signature. 
// For example:
// std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> solveMaze(const std::vector<std::vector<char>>& maze);
