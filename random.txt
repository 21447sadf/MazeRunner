This is to write down the logic for the random maze generation.

1. Recursive backtracking
2. Stacks

While there are unvisited neighbors:
Choose a random direction.
If moving in that direction would land you on an unvisited cell:
Carve a path to that cell.
Push your current position onto a stack.
Move to that cell.
Make it the current cell.
If the current cell has no unvisited neighbors:
Pop a cell from the stack.
Make it the current cell.
Repeat until the stack is empty.
